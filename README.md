# Description

`push_swap` is a 42 curriculum project focused on sorting a stack of integers using a limited set of operations and a second auxiliary stack. The goal is to output the shortest (or near‑optimal) sequence of operations that sorts stack A in ascending order while respecting the allowed moves. This project emphasizes algorithmic efficiency, data structures, and careful input validation.

# Instructions

## Compilation

```bash
make
```

## Execution

```bash
./push_swap 3 2 1
```

You can also pass a quoted list:

```bash
./push_swap "3 2 1"
```

## Cleaning

```bash
make clean
make fclean
```

# Resources

- 42 Subject PDF for `push_swap` (project specification and constraints).
- Web articles

## AI Usage

AI assistance was used to:
- Review and update the Makefile to match the project’s folder structure.
- Draft this README template based on the required sections and formatting rules.

No AI‑generated code was added to the sorting logic or stack operations.
